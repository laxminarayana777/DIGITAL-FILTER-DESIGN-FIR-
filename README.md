DESCRIPTION

Designing FIR Filters using MATLAB
In this task,I designed and implemented Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters using MATLAB, a high-level programming language and environment specifically designed for numerical computation and data analysis. The FIR filters designed include low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, and band-stop filters.
FIR Filters
Low-Pass FIR Filter
The low-pass FIR filter is designed to allow low-frequency signals to pass through while attenuating high-frequency signals. The filter coefficients are calculated using the freqz function in MATLAB, which computes the frequency response of the filter.
High-Pass FIR Filter
The high-pass FIR filter is designed to allow high-frequency signals to pass through while attenuating low-frequency signals. The filter coefficients are calculated using the freqz function in MATLAB.
Band-Pass FIR Filter
The band-pass FIR filter is designed to allow signals within a specific frequency band to pass through while attenuating signals outside of this band. The filter coefficients are calculated using the freqz function in MATLAB.
Band-Stop FIR Filter
The band-stop FIR filter is designed to attenuate signals within a specific frequency band while allowing signals outside of this band to pass through. The filter coefficients are calculated using the freqz function in MATLAB.
MATLAB Implementation
The FIR filters are implemented in MATLAB using the freqz and impz functions. The freqz function computes the frequency response of the filter, while the impz function computes the impulse response of the filter. The filter coefficients are calculated and plotted using MATLAB's built-in plotting functions.
In conclusion, designing FIR filters using MATLAB provides a powerful and flexible way to analyze and process signals. The freqz and impz functions provide a convenient way to compute the frequency and impulse responses of the filter, respectively.
